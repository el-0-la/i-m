In it's simplest form, a manifesto is an expression of intent and action.

For this post, my intention is to outline my steps towards creating my manifesto as well as share why I am writing one.

<b>why a manifesto?</b>

I think of manifestos as a physical road map of my morality and personal ethics. I get lost and off-track at times and having a manifesto serves as a reminder that I have goals and ideas that I wish to bring to light and reality.

To begin the process of writing a manifesto, it is helpful to consider the following questions and to take some notes as you go along. Personally, I find it much easier to take these notes using a pen and paperâ€”-the idea here is not to make anything pretty, but to get ideas out.

The main question is <em>What do I want?</em> This is a pretty broad question, but without any idea, it's hard to start. 

This can be broken down into smaller questions like:
* What benefits would I see if XYZ were to happen?
* What is the problem? And am I willing to work for a solution? If you answer no, then maybe a you should write a manifesto for something else.
* What does a successful outcome look like?
* What actionable steps can I take to work towards accomplishing this goal?
* Are there roadblocks to achieving what I want? Are there things I can do to mitigate these roadblocks?

Other questions to consider:
* Does taking action benefit my commnunity?
